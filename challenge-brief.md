## Brief

Your challenge is to build out this 8-page planets fact site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local data.json file for the planets. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate .html files.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between the "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology" tabs

Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
