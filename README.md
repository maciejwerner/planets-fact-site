## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla HTML
- Vanilla JS
- SCSS - 7 -1 approach
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

The project was more difficult and took me more time than I thought. I added an animation of the components that appear on the screen.

### Continued development

I'm going to create more apps to get more confidence and speed.
